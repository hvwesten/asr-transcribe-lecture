so any way the course i'm going to teach is called financial theory and i'm going to talk about i'm going to teach him actual class on the spent the first half the class talking about the course and while you might be interested in it and then i'm going to start with the course i mean that that many lectures available the semester saw i'm not going to waste this on another first half the class is going to be but why to study it and the mechanics of the course and the second half looked lecture is going to be actually the first part of the course they'll give you may be an idea of whether you'll find the course interesting too southerner so you should know that finance was not taught until ten years ago at yale it was regarded by the deans and the classically minded faculty of the arts and sciences as a vocational subject not worthy of being taught to yale and the graduates it was growing more and more famous however in the world and there was a band of business school professors fisher black robert martin william sharp steamroller who had a huge following in business schools teaching the subject and who students went off on to wall street and more less dominated the investment banking to the parallel successful financiers of business physiologically called efficient markets and the idea that airiest all the available possible information so implication of that is that you are to find out whether a company is doing well or not you don't have to take the trouble to read all their financial ports just look at their stock price you want to know whether it countries doing well or not you don't have to study its entire political system and you know current events just look at the general stock market of the country in tattletale that you could make his good returns in the market as a la person as you could as an expert because all the experts were competing to try and get the best possible price and so the price itself reflected all their knowledge of wisdom and opinions and so the lay person could take advantage of that by buying stocks everybody should be an investor they felt a monkey throwing darts of the dark board would do as well as any of the great effects now their own fearenside by their own experience because all of them seemed to go out into the world and invest in almost all the maintain returns and made a huge amount of money all which made them even less popular in the faculty of arts and sciences so a critical part of their theory was that the markets were so efficient driven by people like them who are competing to exploit every advantage on their forecome away readvent and by doing that put all the information they have into the prices implication of that theory is that there's an extraordinarily clever way of computing the value of most investment assets and about deciding when a financial decision is a good thing to do or not and that was the heart of what they taught in these business schools these algorithms for valuing assets and making optician decisions one striking thing is that the people they studied the business schoolhouses people and the investment bankers they studied their language so this is never happened in academies ingeniousness professors were studying and musing exactly the language created inarticulate greatest constrained financial economist to begin with the greatest thirteenth century was irving fisher her a lot about he wrote possibly the first economic phaetons to teach him so he had to write his phthia maybe the greatest american physicist of the time things you know and since he materialistic constantly finance the most famous elicited half of the twentieth century was changed to a famous back oeconomist most famous macstronachlacher a long tradition of finance and economics and had talents not a vocational subject it's actually central to economics and central to understanding the economy and central understanding the gloomy so we'd like to tolerable a few of them will actually take the course and so they agreed to let us do it and so we can teaching it now for the last ten years as you know i clearsighted fanatic the thought which he thinks has a big an effect on prices as the hard information about profits that the business school professors imagined drove profit i myself have been quite critical of financial theory i started off as the straight pure mathematical economist to me economics is almost a branch of logic and philosophy that happened to tell you something about the world so i got my withholding came back to adjoin the old foundation the colonnas basically economics or mathematical economic social science ought to be amenable to mathematical analysis just like physics or chemistry as a people didn't believe this at first and the cold foundation which you'll hear a lot about eleseus led the revolution in transforming it from a subject political economy into a mathematical subject well i decided around nineteen eighty nine that since i did mathematical economics in the alleys finance people doing all kinds of mathematical things on wall street and doing it very successfully you know i thought i might just check out what they were doing so it might be fun to see what they were up to wetterstein to another and they decided that they wanted to organize the research department in fixed income and since i was a professor there and i did mathematical economics is there for the whole year somebody said the director of fictioneers each department for me so i did and ultimately there were seventy five people in the department all the time i was a professor at yale and after five years epode those hundred thirty five years old formed by a famous family then should sound peabody familiar to you he closed down after a hundred thirty five years five years after i got there i had to invite the seventy five people i hired into my office and say you're fired and then i went next door to the office next to mine and the guy there said your fire and sit at the wall street and after that six of us found it a hedge fun called ellington capital management which is a warranted and we had all tell you a lot about about it it started after the intercrossing as a rather small hedge fun but it grew into a very big mortgaged fifties organically found out the back practically everybody adores is basically a hedge unmanageableness but we're still here she experiences of course have colored yunnanese so i took on in my theoretical work finance and economic theories on terms i didn't think it introduce psychology economics i just take it on its own terms on its own mathematical terms and what i found was that there are two things missing in the standard theory one is that it basilic tly assumes you can buy insurance for everything so they sumption ascal complete markets and secondly it leaves out collateral entirely she never see almost in any single economic textbook the idea of collateral leverage and those i think the idea get insurance for everything and that you need collateral and have to be able to convince some one you're going to pay him back if you borrow money and collaterals and most convincing way of persuading him he's going to be paid back the listlessness you picture here maybe i will you know how bad the crash was so let's look at the dawsons the doones the doones as an average of thirty stocks and what their value is will talk more about it later but here it is back to nineteen thirteen moving along reasonably going up and up and up you know there are few lips which will come to later like this one nineteen twenty nine and then the look what happened lately look at that hospital you know six thousand five hundred something like that i more than a fifty per cent drop and now it's gone fifty percent up again so if you believe these finance professors you'll have you have to say that everybody realized that profiteers in america were going to be less than half what they thought they were going to be before and that's why the stock market do and then races on a hit bottom everybody feet oh my gosh we misunderstood things actually is not nearly that bad and things percentages and things were so high and penitents were terrible and you know that history the gets it up again they changed their mind again but okay so all right now by the way it's a little bit better to look at the dancing for inflation and then you see that you know the nineteen twenty nine crash looks and this is analogical so the same as you know remonstrated years that it hardly seemed like anything was happening will now and locale you know going up two of these is mount playing by ten you see that the interestin in nineteen twenty nine of the early thirties to stock market flourishing astonishment not a penitent notwithstanding downheartedness roundaboutness tolerates no it's very difficult to predict with the stock markets going up or down seems to be random well it's random and they used to think it was normally distributed lot of people argued was normally distributed but you know it's hard you never get these gigantic outliers of things are normally distributed they're just weighing too unlikely to happen so mandowie professor or at iredale years ago it wasn't when he formed his theory the inventor of fracases this couldn't possibly be a random walk in the traditional browndown instead because he never get these big outliers but he offered no explanation for why they might be there and you know i don't know sir has an explanation either i mean isn't that people suddenly get shocked one day in the one week they changed their mind and things aren't so bad after all but you see heterodox these kinds of things now let's just look at the downheartedness utterances attribution of the population to another the oatcake which wouldn't have been entertained by these original financial theories is that democracy is something to do with the stock market not information about profits and returns but the distribution of ages and the population so i'm not saying the theory is correct although i was one of the proponents of it but it leaves it shows that there's runnin things for democracy to matter for leverage the matter and not just for expectations about future profits so let's let me show you another picture so this is a second way in which shelley famous he said well look at housing prices the cashiering index so is also famous because he had the idea of collecting housing prices you know it's quite amazing every town has to record you know it's by law you have to record in the town directory and are often on the internet what the prices of every sale of every house so everybody has an it's all publicly valable on the internet and are most of it is publicly available on the internet and nobody thought to gather all this information together and take the average and like down an index okay until showered so here is the shower index which is all right that using prices were pretty stable you know throughout the eighties and then in round two thousand they started taking off so this is on the stock market was taking off too so shoeshiner people just went crazy they somehow think things can never go down in the just going to keep going up and the keeping cause they think things are going to go up and it's crazy and things are going you know psychology eventually operations go down and things went on now i think there's something to psychology there is something missing in the original finance story the finance guy by the way they would say well the rise is not so surprising look at the mortgage rate this is the interest rate you have to pay to get a morning there's been an incredible decline in margaret the years so it's easier less costly to buy housing he take the present value of your expenditures and buying the knottiest the future benefits on a lower rate about this coming later so there's no mystery on the other hand they don't have any nothing happened to interest rates they kept getting lawyer lower so there's no reason why the market should have crashed so again this seems like indication for siller now it also in a way is an indication for my theory which is none cyclical so distrustful a little bit of psychology because anything grapestone otiate two things the interest rate and how much collaterally put up who's going to trust you to pay back when you buy a house they say you can't just borrow the whole value of the house they say will make a down payment of twenty percent open of the value of a house and i say is that instead of ignoration to the interest rate think about the collateral rate why is it twenty per cent that you have to put down may be it should be ten per cent or forty percent will fact that number changes all the time so here what i've done is the pink line from two thousand to the future that pink line is chilling index inverted noticed the scale on the right as the housing prices but i inverted it okay and on the left i have the down payment per centage so it starts at fourteen these not not for inconsolable and lower and lower and i got down to three per cent you could put down three per cent of the value the house and borrow the other ninety seven per cent of the value of the house the by it so amazingly the prices go down just with what's called the leverage so whiskerage because the amount of the cash put down payment they ten per cent you can lever it up and on an ass it that's worth a hundred event down ten dollars your leverage ten to one if you were down three dollars you can leverage it annoyed one that's toastmaster or money down again and sure enough the price is turned around so he looked at the prices worries again the inverse on the right and you look at the margins on the left not for buying houses but for buying securities i don't have time to explain his whole craft but the blue line is the buying securities so ninety eight is a big crisis the margin spike up inattention themselves don't pay cash thereunto put down percentage happened to prices prices this is the universal prices and two thousand seven they started to collapse occasion up his prices are collapsing so once again the margins touraineans lower prices and is a large and down recently the prices of one presently so it's an alternative theory so attested financial theory is wrong after all i help run a hedge fun six of us founded it with wenuses for fifteen years we must believe in standard financial theory because that's how we've been making a lot of our money that we explain all those algorithms and most of the things i'm going to teach you i certainly believe it and it's very important to that again today but there's more fit the semester but there's more to the theory then just that so let me show you the doubt i want to say one thing thereinafter now what was the date the date pistols here okay so october first two thousand seven okay now let's just so that's when people started to realize something was wrong with the world and things had down in a white if you look at and until then nothing bad seemed to be happening in the world but suppose that you looked not at the suppose you looked sorry ok here's a gran suppose you look suppose you looked at the sub prime mortgage index you see it's a hundred you'll understand what these things are so a hundred means nobody thinks is going to be in the fall over here january two thousand seven ten months before the stock market starts to go down before it hits its pent the stock market going up here a month later this is april thunderclaps hounded to six were already in february or march two thousand seven so that means the people those experts trading mortgages already realized there was a calamity about to happen this was long before any one else perceived anything happening long before the stock market move long before the government did anything to correct the problem so justice financial theory says if you pay attention to the prices you can learn a lot about the world the people trading those things their life depends on fixing the right prices probably they know stuff that you don't know the prices are reflect their opinion if the price collapsed part of the reason it collapse may be martinswand a half years we've known there's going to be a major catastrophe in gagement houses another three and a half million repartimientos masthead the market polarisation half years ago and nobody's but done anything about it basically until now as will find out so it's not that i think financial theory the sardinia theories wrong i think it's incredibly littlechester so by the way just to hunsdon just leontodon think that was a total failure soeren her ego emeritus and sort of interesting so we started in nineteen o thankin out of business in nineteen ninety four there was a tremendous crash in the market alone the leverage cycle the purple is ellington that the hedge fools that these are other investment opportunities the spine is the green thing which looked like it was doing great for a while emerging markets is the blue one and i yield as the greenhorns like treasures and this is lorendiac that to this says if you put your money into any of those strategies you know in liberty but you know lending your money each month to a bank and seeing what interesting gets how much money you cumulate or putting your money and ellington and looking at the purple or putting your dollar into the stock market and see what happens he hasn't been five hundred this is what happens so you see there was a crash here you know your fire your fire so we start ellington and progenitor does great and so we have all these use doing great than ninety eight there's another crash look what happened overnight practically lost the huge amount of money we almost went out of business long term capital which by the way was on partly by two noble prize winners merinville numbered miller a mirasol and robert martin to the guys i mentioned who are leaders of the financial crisis in bankrupted their company and they went out of business and why did they go to business as they weren't aware of the leveretts returns shoot up again and the loord seems to be doing great the stock market everybody's doing great then there's another crisis in two thousand seven everything plummetted going up again so you know it's hard to see this and to linthaughs i remember in ninety eight for example when there was a margin call or lenders called and said we want more money we don't believe that the assets are worth as much as they were until the collaterals not covering alone any more and we said you can't make a margin all is not legal you promise not to change the margins on us for six months you can't make a marginalia that were making a margin call so we called up orbetello making margin commando this we have great bondoni wrong with the boosters to sell all the bonds to pay them the money and how can they force us to do that they should foresightedness all the bonds on you know on today to tintometer martincole get terrible prices from the bonds of weediness even though the great bond just as their making a marginalis and save us and you'll get rich on part of a great company and he said well it sounds like i should just show up on tuesday and by the bonds so that she survived the fissure the ill tell you more my what we did we orvietan dormund then although he had a pretty good idea and then we then we survived the last pressnell's crashes but the fact is things go up the chthonian i decided that can't be all my fault it's got to be there something more basic at work and that's why i'm going to tell you about the leverance that you know my pet theories may not turn out to be right although i think more and more people are starting to think there's something to it so i'm not going to spend you know a huge bush portion of the course just talking about my pet ferries i mean i recognize that you know i have to teach partly what standards so what i would oeconomie in the following way i'm going to spend malatesta nor arbitrate financial theory and i metal about it theoretically and mathematically and from a practical point of view you know because hoopington the hedge unostentatious taught from a hedge unprospected botterill and from a practical point of view on the other hand i live now to the mortgage crises and so it seems silly for me not to describe how the mortgage market works you know he'll find almost none of that in any standard finance textbook how the mortgage market works and you know what's going on and what what happened in the crises and how we survive to how other people didn't holakau the levers spend some time i think it's quite important on the mathematical logic of the invisible hand argument that's the most important argument in economics you know that the free market does good for the economy and a huge number of people believe it and in part of that argument and part of the sort of hazing knowledge of that argument is what drives resistance to a lot of government programs i mean the government can only screwing up is what people generally believe and is it a prejudice or to some actual argument behind that i want to go over that argument and show you precisely how it works and how it doesn't work and in the financial peradenia to talk about social security that's one marshmoreton would do that if they thought they were going to be the last generation pain to the old and when they got old nobody would help them so society rests on this world bring on fever which makes it mathematically interesting and stinted point of view and then i got put in all these national academy panels and social security and privation and so i know quite a bit about it so i might as well talk about something i know about so that's that all right so the two hard forests so let me just give you a few examples ooseemeeid oftentimes theory somethingorother now but by the end of the course he should be totally obvious to you so suppose you win the lottery forty million dollars otterhound million dollars the lottery and they always give you the choice you want to take five million a year over twenty years or just get forty million dollars right now which would you do and how do you think about what to do that one now you get terenty thousand dollars a year and you think you know professor and going up with the rat of inflation and that's about it for the next twenty years to you retire and then sat twenty years of that and then you're going to live another twenty years when you go making nothing souhaitons a assailant and what you'd like to do is come inflation corrected the same amount every year after you retire before you retire so how much of the hundred fifty thousand should you spend this year and how much should you say that atheromatous going to weather it but galeotti percent probably in its indolent that's five billion dollars almost of the twenty three billion dollar endowment to how much should he choose to cut his decision how much should yell reduced spending every year spending the total spending yale is a little over two billion so the endowments by five billion what cut holyoke to the budget should faculty salaries be cut the frozen should you know as you know the taste of fortitude do how big a cut you you take out the same question faced all in nineteen ninety six or so i forgot exactly the year ten or twelve years ago the previous president banishment that there was deferred maintenance as he called it is a billion dollars to fix the all buildings that's why incidentally every year another college gets fixed they decided there was deferred maintenance of a billion dollars and had a hundred million dollars over every year for ten years had to be spent the whole endowment than was three million and now we had a one billion dollar deferred maintenance problem the budget was about one million then so how much sand you cut the gauge at that time so banishing fifteen percent of the faculty enounced he was firing fifteen percent of the faculty that was in the front page of the national well heathenesse three months later so probably not but what i did he make in his calculations what should he have done what was the right response sweetheart's take let's take a slightly more complicated one you're a buck and you told series is coming up the yankees were playing the dodonaean of friends who you know every game will be willing to be even odds on either side authenticates comes to you and says he's a yankee fantasies beechhurst to hundred when the evenshualities do you do what can you do these friends were willing to be even as each game by game so how much money presumably the first night you're going to bet with one of your friends then you take the guy's bed the customer you take us three hundred thousand you promised to deliver him five hundred back at the ancient keep it if the anchises what should you do with your friends holdeth yankees with your friends so you boone dodge with your friends and how much should you bet and even odds the first night caledon so the answer is well i don't want to give all the answers now but so there's a way of skilfully betting with your friends and not betting two hundred or three hundred thousand the first night with your friends doubtsome number than that which you'll figure out how much the bet so that if you keep that in thoughtlessness you can never lose a penny a buoyance thing that you're going to singulierement way you can quit whenever you want all right socialist card looks like an even chance of winning or losing let's say you pick the first card and black went a dollar now the guy says you want to do it again the back is twenty six he picked a black one ostent six red laughed and twenty five black so snowdonian card aldous's like shoulderache up the card and i can even tell you how many cards to pick even if you keep getting black and should keep picking and picking so how could that be it sounds kind of shocking well it's going to turn out to be very simple for you to say halfway through the course so let's spoletta now you can get for five and three quarter percent interest their fifteen year mortgage is even get for less like five point three per cent interest on ortenter should you take the fifteen year morettina price than the other one more example suppose you're banknotes that means the people in the houses of you went on the money they're promising to pay you back and you value all those mortgages at a hundred million dollars the interest rates go down the government lowers the interest rate half of them to refinements big as the original pool is that worth fifty million half of what it was before or more than fifty million were less than fifty million how would you decide that again this is a question which might be a little puzzling now but actually you should be able to get the sign of that to day and tartarin's what more traders have to do they see interest wait then down a bunch of people acted the people are left in the pool are different from the people who starting to revalue everything and we think it all so how should we do that let's say you want a hedge fund some investor comes to insisting are terrible look at all the money you lost from me last year you know i know you're doing great this year and you made it all back that you lost last year but you know i don't want to run that risk so i want to give you a month my money a billion dollars in wantage these superior returns you seem to earn but you have to guarantee that you don't lose me a penny i don't want to run any risk i want a principal guarantee it's called that when i give you a hundred dollars i'll never have you always return my hundreds and hopefully much more but never less than hundred dollars so is there any way to do that or you know you know that you've got a great strategy but of course it's rikorians a potential cure for aid if it works he's going to make a fortune started a company to ilsenstein school started the start up company yesterday start up company and if this thing really works he's going to make a fortune it doesn't work it's going to be totally zero you calculate on believe your calculation that the expected profits that he'll make if it were you now the probability of it working times the profit that expected profit is equal to the profits of all of general electric should his company we worth more than general electric the same as general electric were less than general electric since it got the same expected profits well i can tell you the answer to this one because i think most of you would think first you think will maybe the same tenants what was an think it so risky to the relay aerating and the so risky and general electric ossoli probably the generic is worth more but the answer is the acompanied worth more so how could that be so another kind of another question suppose you believe in the sufficient market stuff and you rank all the stocks at the end of this year from top to bottom of which stock had the highest return over the year twenty ten but say twenty ten this year a werdende ten all the stocks the highest return to the lowest return now suppose you did the same thing in twenty eleven with the same stocks would you expect to get the same order or the reverse order were random warder now again if you believe in efficient market in the markets really functioning the prices are fair and all abattis he won't know but you might say should be random the next time because you know firmament worse by luck but that's not right either so you goin know how to answer that question by the end of the class kynaston you know and down one over the last fifteen years has gotten something like a fifteen per cent annalise return i had in that i won't name has gotten eleven per cent over the last fifteen years counting all its losses and stuff like that so is it obvious that the yale endowment is done better than the hedge fun would you say that the yale manager is better than the hedge fulminate its return was fifteen per cent the hedge folliot eleven per cent so i'm asking the question and i would say that david swinton would think about it the same way i think about it so suppose i even told you that the yale hedge fund had lower volatility than the handelian now that the andaman managed better than edgefield we're gonna answer this question again and you're going to see that the answer little surprising so of hope so surprising i wouldn't have brought it up anyway so now the butterman's kind of thing that in finance or taught to think about so the crisis of two thousand seven whichelo time talking about i just want to get back to that subject soothliness i was confident about my theory of crises and the kind of questions you have to face all the time and hegesistratus bisonette wrong and morganton and fended mortgages unwashed money they put up collateral they don't pay and take the house or you take the guy's life you know he's a slave or something but it's the same thing you put a barrow money and the gay promises you can configuration that you know how could that be so and why should a screw up in the morganatic on the rest of the economy or submerged or some logic to it you know and how did we get out of the crisis how is it that everybody was saying this is the worst crisis as the depression may be in other depression and things seemed to have turned around what is it that we did to get things to turn around i don't think we're out of it yet but things are not better than the warheads what is it that the government did the turn things around it then donnerent i think but it did something what exactly what did it do now sillerton was irrational exuberance i'm going to say all the leeuwarden and pollution and things like that interfere with the free market and they have to be regulated but the financial markets there's no monopoly in as long as there's no monopoly in there's no pollution shouldn't the free market function there so i want to go over that argument and show you what was missing in it as i said before and the last laborosoarchod running people like you are going to get a cent rate of return if you put your money in the senior the last crash over the long halvorsen so it's terrible social security something's wrong with the system we should private it hit everybody young people like you put your money in stocks instead well gore in the debate in two thousand said you can't do that because then the old people are expecting their money can't get paid and both of them agreed that you know is all the baby boerstler getting older north's why this is going to getanittowit youngest langethal street and was created by professors and practitioners use it in this forschungstein decisions pentacosiomedimni helpful because this logic of the free market being good or bad you know that was already started and he kindheartedness not googagoo's relentless over and over again and i can tell you that every year there's a five percent of the watyonkwentendane probably not that you know those men that much experience dignerfied it to contestation couldn't take this course so if you're not confident doing little mathematical promise just don't take the course you'll save yourself a lot of trouble i don't know how to say this any better i want to warn you not to do it it's easy not but it never stops every week there's going to be a problem set them their problems is doing problems just like the problem set but if you don't like that you know to me financially for something it's very concrete and went take advantage of the concreteness by turning every question into a number i hate it when you get on the one hand and on the other hand an you know you know it's a number and so the self you don't like numbers it's not a good course to take what are the kinds of things you have to understand beplastering this tuesday to the next tuesday the two mineralogically the first meadows and one examine rest i'll tend to ignore that but most people don't by the way do vastly worse some one examined the rest o the finsteraarhorn to start next thursday so you see the two classes you know the classes are tuesday thursday then the next tuesday the long time in between her so all the tassels textbooks all by the nobel prize was all by those financial ratsbane them but i have my own lecture notes because as i say tovaristchi some of them are incredibly interesting and fun and so they're all the readiness you can take a look at i mean has never been more fun time to read this stuff now kasserota so i run now ostasio about how the course were unanswered how i will run in or whether you think you should take the course or whether our preparations so if you haven't taken a confitentibus got to be confident that you can solve problems although it any questions yes yes so next tuesday it's going to be to the tuesday after so i know that's early but you know he probably already know what they're going to take the course of ages we teach it next year actually i probably won't because i'm going to go on leave but i might if the probably not but you know some one else will teach it yet i don't really see you know but they're all good so they are all you know they're all famous people of written the books are too you know the chinese copies so their pitched at a quite low level and there but they're very good so i would you know any one of them is good millersburg so is restive ross is a friend of mine used to teach it hailstones book is good so any one of those is very good but they're not quite at the same mathematical level because they're trying to sell you know thousands of books and the thick quick pretty pretty closely to this financial bedewed that everything's efficient yes that's a good question i don't think so no there shaking their heads won't be in time for you but it will be if you want to look back in your old age sweetheart class of the first twelve of them are there and i'm going to know i'm changing ethelbertha you should be signing up now i think on't thirtieth courtesying glad you asked me again so i went over the things you have to have betterment of you have to take the derivative one over if you got three explosives ten and two explanations that simultaneous equation so that's the kind of thing i have to do and you have to be able to do it quickly and with thoracic that you're doing it right and you know footman of you that's no problem but for some of you who are maybe even smarter than everybody else that's a problem and so you'll have to judge yourself whether you can do that comfortably see it don't have to worry about the mechanics of doing that you can think conception with the questions asking all right i wanted no one that we have monastique tentage have fifteen thirteen minutes i want to and with one experiment so antony help me with this so lissome thing we're not going to have time to figure out the answer to but so okay so what i had so i mean sixteen volunteers about the first two rows on intestate the old survive and you know i know it's a drag but you'll do it oshondonto so please stand up and at em you go to the side ameera's okay you're willomene one's reluctant to do this but only men sixteen beacon of two four six eight okusama with as aren't going to participate you don't need to you're not in this right no two four six eight so we only need it would you my reattachment goobers and eight he sacerdotale okay so we've got eight and these are the football their selling so i've got eight sailors and eight fires and i don't there the experiment before i didn't want but shuffle them right there in the allbut you got to shuffle them on the other side is a number okay so we've got eight sailors here and at fires so each seller knows what his football ticket is worth or hurt so please take one seventieth you say by any okay you should be one short here's an extra you okay so there ain't serenity got the football tickets each of them knows what the football ticket is worth to her were women here only to somerset anthem but she knows exactly what it's worth to her so say it's fifteen tobalito fifteen now she can sell it for more than fifteen she's going to do it to make a profit if she sells it for less than fifteen she's not a very good trainer okshitgon to do that she's going to say if i can get more than the football thicket is worth i'm going to sell it i can get worse i can't get more than its worth i won't sell it kasoer body knows what the football thickets worth to herself all these guys they know what the ticket is worth to them so say so on things is worth thirty that guy's going to say if i can get it for less than thirty like for fifteen i'm going to get it if i can get you know that give me a profit of fifteen if if i can only get it for forty i'm sure not going to do that because i'm paying more than i think it's worth occasion that you have a reservation value self you don't want to pay more than it's worth because then you losing money and they want to sell it for more than they think it's worth canonically across the classes experiment i'm not the first one to run at all but done it for ten years i do it my graduate class in my undergraduate class the undergraduates or by the way always do better than the graduate students but anyway so there is no senegalensis and nothing sensible is going to happen and that does happen will be very brassing for me but what the officer markets gus would say is something amazing is going to happen the markandeya experience andronitis to do this so sethosis got eight minutes to go youngster financially only two minutes of training they are going to get to a result which if i had to do it myself and read all the numbers and sort the mountains for toleration two minutes and all this is going to happen until minutes it's hard to believe it probably won't happen this time so here are the rules importeth start inching your way towards each other okanagon be for two minutes you're going to start yelling out an offer so if you think it's worth fifteen and you're a selling to sell it for fifteen you're going to say give me twenty or give me thirty or give me you know twenty five or gottesthal levantines to beauteous who stoutening back here backseat be public outcry is very important that you're telling these things publicly and every all the other people can hear you and i've only got two minutes now two minutes sounds like two minute sounds like an incredibly short period of time which it is but it's much longer than you think you wielandstein doing something really stupid to minutes now it sounds share is actually a very long period of time so be patient try to get the best possible price and we'll see what happens any questions about what you're doing and now in the heat of the moment you might you know be so frustrated that you can't sell when you think it's worth fifteen that you sell it for ten i'm going to expose you in front of all these people to do that so chechacho think the things worth it any questions anybody about what is going on okamisan there a second hand there i can't see it in the reiteration ottomanisation stood you get all the numbers attached ventilation the one restoration thirty four so to forty thirty seven and twenty eight sold to thirty six at thirty two all that could have been could have had eight trades so what what did happen nothing like that happened you had five trade five pairs of people traded and there lose three poor swampers of people at the end looking despondent hopeless unable to trade wearing that they were on camera so is the meteor the people who traded sobersides what happened mister sellar ten so the thirty six at a price of twenty mister sellar nine sold to buy or twenty sonnenstein a price of sixteen at a price of twenty or twenty paid twenty so seller six did well we won't ask who by twenties for twenty okay and conoscenti up so by her fourteen i can't read this either by our fourteen saltpeter for twenty and by her twenty sotherton two and a byword for so the bitten five of people traded now which five were they the cellars were ten six fourteen and twenty four one two three four five the bottom five to five buyers were thirty work thirty six twenty forty four forty and thirty so basically the forty four forty thirty six thirty twenty six to bientot dead so if you look at it so it's not quite the way they would have predicted but as if you look at it he loitered of her to the bottom in from bottom to top he got it too like a demand curve and a supply curve and so it happened all these five people ended up selling one two three four five moser exactly the sellers the price they sold for was all between twenty and twenty five and the five buyers were forty four forty thirty sixth thirty twenty six of the mangoes basically the owthwaite free what is the theory of the remark of the theaters this chaotic situation with adolescent to inspect do could be analyzed as if imputed the man curved together with a supply curante was one price that they graceless have been twenty five and turned out to be twenty or twenty two that all the trade took place at at that one price who get all the trains happening the people in the highest valuation buyers they're the ones who get the tickets the people with the lowest valuation sellers selling so the people went up with the tickets are these red guys at the top and the blue guys at the top all would take its gormeston and two minutes there was one mistake mister miss twenty whose identity we are protecting him searching the faces mister or miss twenty got a very bad deal she or he let's say he bought a twenty on the value was twenty that was horrible deal he so he shouldn't have you know i didn't get any extra automat so he should probably have only bought at the price were lower and then twenty six would have bought instead of twenty so twenty sort of squeezed his way into the market so twenty six and twenty between them somehow there was a slight inefficiency but basically with no training no background no practice these sixteen hundred graduates managed to reproduce the gathered all the information the whole economy may discover who are the fifth two or the eighth of the sororities the eight people who valued the tickets the most and they ended up with all the tickets in now for me to do it and sorehearted longer the market so accomplice problem gets information incredibly quickly and put things into the hands of the people who value at the most and the marginal birettas worth about twenty five or twenty and that's what the price turned out to be saysx
